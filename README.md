# Pico-8

## Development
I use Sublime Text 3 with the PICO-8 package. (follow install procedure for font)
Here is my config :
```json
{
	"font_size": 16,
	"highlight_line": true,
	"line_padding_bottom": 4,
	"line_padding_top": 4,
	"pico-8_path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PICO-8\\pico8.exe",
	"rulers":
	[
		32
	]
}
```
Here is a preview of what it all looks like :
